<p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">Get customized, interactive visuals all in one box.<br>
Simple to use, stable, and built specifically for your project.<br><br><br>

<a name="FAQ"></a><strong>How Does It Work?</strong><br>
<br>
Audio goes in. Video goes out.<br>
(If you want it, audio can go out too.)<br>
<br>
[diagram]<br>
<br>
Audio input and output jacks are RCA (adapters for XLR or instrument cables are available).<br>
<br>
Video output is HDMI (adapters for other video formats are available as well).<br>
<br>
<strong>How Do I Operate It?</strong><br>
<br>
The device itself simply turns on and off, and it includes knobs to adjust the input and output volumes.<br>
<br>
The program it runs can work with a standard USB keyboard, a MIDI device, an X Box controller, or any number of custom options--including wireless possibilities!<br>
<br>
<strong>Where Can I Learn More?</strong><br>
<br>
[resources, source code, and links to hardware/software]<br>
<br>
<strong>So, I Can Just Make All This Myself?</strong><br>
<br>
Sure!<br>
<br>
Every component is open source. If you have the spare time and the desire to learn, go for it!<br>
<br>
Of course, you can also record yourself, distribute yourself, manage yourself, book yourself, promote yourself, and pretty much tackle any other aspect of a creative career on your own too. If you actually want to focus on making music, doing everything on your own may not be the best use of your time.<br>
