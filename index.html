How Does It Work?

Audio goes in, Video (and Audio) come out.

[diagram]

Audio input and output jacks are RCA (adapters for XLR or instrument cables are available).

Video output is HDMI (adapters for other video formats are available as well).

How Do I Operate It?

The device itself simply turns on and off, and it includes knobs to adjust the input and output volumes.

The program it runs can work with a standard USB keyboard, a MIDI device, an X Box controller, or any number of custom options--including wireless possibilities!

Where Can I Learn More?
[resources, including source code and links to every piece of hardware and software used]
...
Can't I Just Make All This Myself?

Sure!

Every component is Open Source. If you have the spare time and the desire to learn, go for it.

You can also promote yourself, book yourself, distribute yourself, manage yourself, record yourself, and pretty much handle any other aspect of a musical career or hobby on your own. Of course, doing absolutely everything on your own may not be the best use of your time.

We're here to provide a much-needed service to the many musicians that don't have spare time and energy to devote to programming, building, and maintaining a live, interactive visual component for their show. Some folks need to focus on music exclusively, and that's great! We offer creative visual collaboration and technical support for whomever needs it.
